To set an initial topology, run perl make_topology.pl thetopofile (an example topology file is provided).
This will set the connectivity between nodes. To give them their initial costs, provide each with an
initialcosts file (examples of these are provided as well. See the spec document for more details on all
file formats). You can just give them all an empty file, if you want all links to default to cost 1.

To make the nodes send messages, or change link costs while the programs are running, use manager_send.

To bring links up and down while running:
e.g. to bring the link between nodes 1 and 2 up: 
sudo iptables -I OUTPUT -s 10.1.1.1 -d 10.1.1.2 -j ACCEPT ; sudo iptables -I OUTPUT -s 10.1.1.2 -d 10.1.1.1 -j ACCEPT

To take that link down:
sudo iptables -D OUTPUT -s 10.1.1.1 -d 10.1.1.2 -j ACCEPT ; sudo iptables -D OUTPUT -s 10.1.1.2 -d 10.1.1.1 -j ACCEPT




log file format:
sprintf(logLine, "sending packet dest %d nexthop %d message %s\n", dest, nexthop, message);
sprintf(logLine, "forward packet dest %d nexthop %d message %s\n", dest, nexthop, message);
sprintf(logLine, "receive packet message %s\n", message);
sprintf(logLine, "unreachable dest %d\n", dest);

... and then fwrite(logLine, 1, strlen(logLine), theLogFile);

If that's all you do to the log file, you will have the correct format. (Don't worry about closing it; 
when your process gets killed, any output should be flushed + the file will be closed).


TO MAKE THE AUTOTESTER NOTICE YOU:
To have the tester test your LS implementation (binary must be named ls_router), commit a file called "testls".
To have the tester test your DV/PV implementation (binary must be named vec_router), commit "testvec".
